This is a remake of the old Amiga game [Tower of Babel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmHO4udMD7s) made with Unity3d.

Since I do not have the time anymore to continue working alone on this I 
decided to make it open source on github and hopefully some people are interested
and willing to continue the work. The game is basically playable and all
original levels are available. Still a couple of things are missing:

 * The "programming the robots" part which prevents some levels to be solved
 * Menus and so on
 * Better graphics and animations
 * and much more ;)

I do not know if it runs on the latest Unity3d version anymore and most
likely needs some adaption to this.
